        FIX: this previously iterated `self.pos_index[type_]` directly.
        `pos_index` is keyed by the object IRI of a triple, so indexing it
        with a *class* IRI returned the triples that point at the class
        itself rather than at its instances. In practice those are almost
        entirely the `?x rdf:type <type_>` assertions, which
        Engine.add_triple_pattern rejects unconditionally, so P-(c) was
        effectively empty for every dump-indexed repository and the
        incoming exploration contributed nothing at all.

        The instances of `type_` are now resolved through `type_index`
        first, and `pos_index` is consulted once per instance.
